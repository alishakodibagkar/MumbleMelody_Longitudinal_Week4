Take a moment to turn the “Unaltered” mode on, test it by repeating a few words out loud (for example, “Testing 1, 2, 3”) and adjust your volume until you comfortably can hear the mode being used.<br><br>If you would like to hear what this mode should sound like, here is a link to our demo beginning at this mode: https://youtu.be/73SNCY7akoE?t=122<br><br>When you are able to hear the Mumble Melody mode, switch your browser back to this questionnaire to continue.
