  <h2>Welcome to the Week 3 Testing Session for the Mumble Melody Longitudinal Study on Stuttering</h2>
  <p>Thank you for participating in our study. We are researchers from MIT working to expand research on audio-based approaches that may help increase fluency for adults who stutter.

    <h3>About this Session</h3>
    <p>Today, we will do a testing session consisting of a baseline assessment of your fluency and an initial assessment using four feedback modes: raw voice, reverb, whisper, and harmony. With those modes, you will hear your voice altered.<br><br>Here is how the session will take place today:
<br>(1) First, we will ask you a few questions
<br>(2) Next, we will ask you to do a volume check to ensure recording quality
<br>(3) Next, we will establish your fluency baseline with a series of open questions
<br>(4) Next, we will use different feedback modes which will change the way you hear your own voice. There are 4 modes and for each of them we will do a shortened version of the fluency assessment test
<br>(5) Finally, we will ask you a few interview questions to get your feedback about the whole experience.
